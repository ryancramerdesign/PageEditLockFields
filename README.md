# Page Edit Lock Fields module

ProcessWire comes with a page-lock feature, where you can lock an entire 
page from being edited. The Page Edit Lock Fields module expands upon that 
feature by making it more granular, providing the ability to lock 
individual fields in the page, rather than the entire page (or entire field 
across all pages). 

While ProcessWire also provides the ability to lock fields 
independent of pages, this module enables you to lock fields directly 
on pages and in the page editor, when and where you are most likely to want to 
do so. [Read more](https://processwire.com/blog/posts/page-edit-lock-fields/)
